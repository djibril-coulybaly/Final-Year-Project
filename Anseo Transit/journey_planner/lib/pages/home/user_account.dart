  Description: This was meant to be the user account section in which users can see their profile in detail and modify their 
               personal information. However due to time constraints, I wasnt able to develop it however it is 
               a feature that I want to implement in the future. A implentation of what I wanted to implement in Anseo Transit 
               is available on Anseo Admin
