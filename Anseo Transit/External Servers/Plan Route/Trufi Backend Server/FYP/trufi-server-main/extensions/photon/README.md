## Description

[Photon](https://photon.komoot.io) by [Komoot](https://komoot.de). This extension powers the online search function and the translation from location coordinates to human friendly place names in the app. With slight configuration and a POI data import to the app this extension is not necessary but its use is recommended in places where mobile data usage does not matter in terms of pricing and availability. In case of the POI data import it means that you need to release a new version of the app in case you want to update the POI extract.

TO DO: Explain how to use the alternative because @ValorNaram itself does not know how that alternative works.
